# Problem 1

After creating a public GitHub repo and local R project, we should upload the _tidyverse_ library as well as the *Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

library(readxl)
trash_wheel_data = read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
      sheet = ("2018 Precipitation")
        
      )  
                              


```
